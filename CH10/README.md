**Refactor your legacy C# code base and improve application performance by applying best practices**

## What is this book about?
Traditionally associated with developing Windows desktop applications and games, C# is now used in a wide variety of domains, such as web and cloud apps, and has become increasingly popular for mobile development. Despite its extensive coding features, professionals experience problems related to efficiency, scalability, and maintainability because of bad code. Clean Code in C# will help you identify these problems and solve them using coding best practices.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Write code that allows software to be modified and adapted over time 
* Implement the fail-pass-refactor methodology using a sample C# console application 
* Address cross-cutting concerns with the help of software design patterns 
* Write custom C# exceptions that provide meaningful information 
* Identify poor quality C# code that needs to be refactored 
* Secure APIs with API keys and protect data using Azure Key Vault 
* Improve your codeâ€™s performance by using tools for profiling and refactoring
